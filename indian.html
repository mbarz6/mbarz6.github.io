<p>Recently, a group of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin scientists sold a copy of their computer algebra system, <em>Riding&nbsp;</em><em>Sine Waves</em>, to Max Mudpuppy. Max Mudpuppie's favorite number is the cube root of 2. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Riding Sine Waves</em> is only capable of doing arithmetic with rational numbers and matrices of rational numbers. This greatly angered Max Mudpuppy, who is now threatening violence against the providers of&nbsp;<em>Riding Sine Waves&nbsp;</em>unless they either refund his purchase or allow him to compute with the cube root of 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dolphin etiquette forbids one from offerring a refund to a terrorist, and so the only choice that remains is to add cube root of 2 arithmetic into&nbsp;<em>Riding Sine Waves</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Riding Sine Waves</em> already has built-in matrix arithmetic. One of the dolphins on the design team, Kat, recalls that there is a 3 by 3 matrix <em>M</em>&nbsp;with integer coefficients obeying the equation&nbsp;<em>M</em><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>= 2<em>I</em>, where&nbsp;<em>I</em> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. If they can find that matrix&nbsp;<em>M</em>, they can perform cube root of 2 arithmetic without needing to re-design their software!</p>
<p>Find a 3 by 3 matrix&nbsp;<em>M&nbsp;</em>which has integer coefficients and cubes to&nbsp;2<em>I</em><em>.</em> Input the coefficients of that matrix.</p>
