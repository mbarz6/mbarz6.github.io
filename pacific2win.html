<p><em>Math note: This problem was designed to force you derive the equality case Young's integral inequality (the only reference I can find is as a subsection on the Wikipedia page for Young's inequality for products--which seems strange to me, since Young's inequality for products is a very very special case of the integral formulation, yet it's the one the article is titled after). Hopefully you'd not seen it already; otherwise, the problem would have been quite boring (and asking you if you had seen it then motivates you to Google it, defeating the purpose of the questioning!). However, given that this inequality seems to only be mentioned in a section of a Wikipedia article about something else, it felt suitably obscure.</em></p>
