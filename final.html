<h1 style="text-align: center;">Max Mudpuppy Stopped; Ocean Saved!</h1>
<p>Congratulations! By solving each puzzle, you've successfully saved the ocean!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/happyaxolotl.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A happy axolotl!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The animals thank you dearly for your efforts.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Happy Valentines Day, Isabel.</h1>
<p>Isabel, I really hope you enjoyed these puzzles. I tried to find interesting problems that alluded to neat general results; hopefully everything seemed fun to you.</p>
<p>I really, really love you, Isabel. You've made me so much happier these past few months, and have really made me feel better about myself. On November 11th, I asked you out for the first time; our first date was on the 14th, exactly 3 months ago from Valentines day. I'm so, so happy with how everything's turned out since then with you, Isabel. It's really difficult to try and describe how happy you've made me with some text in a p tag, but the next time we get to see each other, I'll be sure to give you a good squeeze that can hopefully communicate everything I can't type.</p>
<p>Happy Valentines day, <em>i</em><sup>2</sup>. I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
