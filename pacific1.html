<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Penguin Baby Rescue</strong></h1>
<p>Parker and Patricia Penguin had everything going well: They had good jobs, they loved each other, and they were content with life. Until Max Mudpuppy swiped their child, Puck Penguin! The only way to retrieve Puck is to answer Max Mudpuppy's devilish problem. Unfortunately, Parker, Patricia, and the penguin police working to find Puck are all unable to read English, turning Max's problem into a truly impossible task. Can you help them save Puck?</p>
