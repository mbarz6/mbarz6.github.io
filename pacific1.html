<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Penguin Baby Rescue</strong></h1>
<p>Parker and Patricia Penguin had everything going well: They had good jobs, they loved each other, and they were content with life. Until Max Mudpuppy swiped their child, Puck Penguin! The only way to retrieve Puck is to answer Max Mudpuppy's devilish problem. Unfortunately, Parker, Patricia, and the penguin police working to find Puck are all unable to read English, turning Max's problem into a truly impossible task. Can you help them save Puck?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Max Mudpuppy's Chilly Riddle</strong></h2>
<p><em>p</em> is Max Mudpuppy's favorite prime number. He promises to let Puck go <em>if</em><em>&nbsp;</em>you can find out what&nbsp;<em>p&nbsp;</em>is.</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<em>p<sup>3&nbsp;</sup></em>total monic cubics&nbsp;<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>+ bx + c&nbsp;</em>modulo&nbsp;<em>p</em> (polynomials&nbsp;whose coefficients are integers&nbsp;0, 1, 2, ...,&nbsp;<em>p</em>-1). Max Mudpuppy is evil because he feels incomplete on the inside. So, his favorite polynomials among those &nbsp;<em>p<sup>3&nbsp;</sup></em>monic cubics are those with no roots modulo&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;(meaning that <em>f</em>(0),&nbsp;<em>f</em>(1), ..., <em>f</em>(<em>p</em>-1) are all non-zero modulo&nbsp;<em>p</em>), because a polynomial modulo&nbsp;<em>p</em> with no roots modulo&nbsp;<em>p</em> is also incomplete. He tells you that there are 728 incomplete polynomials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is&nbsp;<em>p</em>?</p>
