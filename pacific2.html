<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anti-Sea Otter Propaganda</strong></h1>
<p>Octavius Otter is a sea otter. Sea otters have were extensively hunted for their fur for hundreds of years, bringing the species to brink of extinction, until sea otter conservation efforts saved them. However, Max Mudpuppy has launched an anti-sea otter propaganda campaign! This campaign has led to a public outcry against sea otters, threatening the conservation effort as politicians remove sea otter hunting restrictions to quell the fears of their constituents. Octavius does not want to die... can you help?</p>
