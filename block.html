                <h1>Reddit, YouTube, etc. are designed to give you frustration, anger, and stress.</h1>
                <h1>What do you get out of them? Some distraction, and some quasi-socialization. </h1>
                <p> Breath in for 5 seconds, breath out for 3 seconds, and then ask yourself what you really need. Can you go back to work?</p>
                <p> If you need distraction, please either listen to music (if you need noise while studying) or pick up a book (if you need a leisurely distraction). </p>
                <p>If you need socialization, just put a Discord message down or send someone a text.</p>
                <p><small>If you <em>really</em> want to, use little laptop yp. But first: breath in for five seconds, breath out for 3 seconds, and then ask if you are you sure it is essential to do this.</small></p>
