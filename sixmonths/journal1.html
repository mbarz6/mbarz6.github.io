<p>Guess who the fuck asked Isabel out? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span>!</p>
<p>MTA: Hard? Then you're probably trying too hard! Look for easy solutions.</p>

<p>Nervous a pros pos d'Isabel. I really hope it goes well!</p>
<p>Went to a combo seminar with Mish[k]a. Was cool, understandable.</p>
<p>Problem: 8x8 chessboard, all squares have a quarter. A king tells you to send the #17 (he could pick any up to 64) to your friend, by only changing at most 1 coin on the board. How?</p>
<p>How long will you be with Isabel for? Let's pray for &gt;1 date!</p>
