<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Math note: You computed the dimension of the space of alternating tensors over a vector space. Alternating tensors seem like they have that weird condition of swapping two input vectors negates the output, but it's actually totally natural: The determinant is an alternating tensor! And since the dimension of alternating rank <em>n</em> tensors over <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> is just 1, that means that the determinant is unique, up to your choice of the volume of the unit hypercube. However, other alternating tensors are still useful, and form the basis of a definition of integration in multivariable settings.)</span></p>
