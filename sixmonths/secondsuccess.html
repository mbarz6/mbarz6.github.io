<p>(Math note: Generally, any map with the property that <em>|f(x) - f(y)| â‰¤ C|x-y|</em> for some constant <em>C</em> smaller than 1 from a compact set to itself has a unique fixed point; this is called the contraction mapping theorem, or sometimes the Banach fixed-point theorem. Alex showed me this theorem for the first time; he tried proving it, failed, and made a comment about the dangers of getting old (thanks Alex, I'll do my best to stop aging!).)</p>
