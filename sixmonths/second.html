<p>Hmm.... wait, look over here!</p>

<p>Help me figure out how much to apply! The instructions say I need to make a 289cc mixture of water and fluid to give to this poor baby ceiling dragon, but it doesn't specify the water to fluid ratio!</p>

<p>How many cc's of <em>fluid</em> should I use? <input type="text" id="password"><br</p>
<p><button onclick="validate()">Submit</button></p>

<script>
function validate() {
  // to prevent one from just guessing the right answer, the validation is a little... complicated
  var x = document.getElementById("password").value
  if (x * x * x * x * x - 11 * x * x * x * x - 23 * x * x * x - 37 * x * x - 24 * x - 26 == 0) {
	document.cookie = "pacific1 = done; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT";
	window.location.href = "https://mbarz6.github.io/pacific1win.html";
  } else {
	alert("Incorrect!");
  }
	
}
