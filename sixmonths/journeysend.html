<p>Thanks for helping out all those animals! They sure are all in debt to you, -1.</p>

I've spent the last six months with one perfect girl. While there's so much to summarize that I couldn't possibly list it all, here are a few highlights I remember...

<h2 style="text-align: center;">November 14th to December 13th</h2>
<p>These were our first moments together... I found some old journal entries from this month that mention you :)</p>
<p>Click <a href="journal1.html">here</a> for the first journal entry.<p>
<p>Click <a href="journal2.html">here</a> for the second journal entry.</p>

<p>(Well, okay, the first one is not quite November 14th, but it's close enough!)</p>
<p>Looking back at it now, any small hopes past Michael had have been achieved and accelerated waaaay past :)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">December 14th to <span class="module__title__link">January</span> 13th</h2>
<p>Merry Christmas! This was a fun month. I got to meet your grandparents and bake some goods with you for New Years; we did a heck of a lot of cuddling and kissing; and yp was born! I'll never ever forget yp, absolutely the most thoughtful Christmas present I have ever gotten... I love him almost as much as I love you! This month was also fun, since I got to give you some (fake) roses and a cool pencil.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="module__title__link">January</span> 14th to February 13th</h2>
<p>Happy Birthday! We had a blast of a party at your house: Alone time at the part swinging and talking about what super powers we'd have if we could have them. Then some fun Mary times making tea, playing board games (I really loved that one where we competed to see who could stay un passed out the longest!), and watching clips from some charmingly bizarre Netflix show on Mary's phone.</p>
<p>And my goodness, while you unfortunately didn't get to be privy to it, this part of our relationship always stands out in my mind for being the time of coming up with the idea of puzzle hunts: from actually designing puzzles to giving them some fun theme to working out the kinks of how in the heck to have a remote puzzle hunt (the web format seems obvious in hindsight, but took me so long to arrive to!), everything just took a long time!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="module__title__link">February </span>14th to March 13th</h2>
<p>Valentine's Day was absolutely enchanting. We had such a blast together at Relo's, I had such a blast reading (and endlessly rereading...) your beautiful card, and I had such a blast munching on some delicious Valentine's Day cookies you baked (I tried saving them to savor over awhile, but I ended up eating them all in a couple days...). It meant so, so much to me to receive something that sweet from you. Your card was beautifully written and just incredible in every single way (though I imagine Incredible Isabel is capable of nothing less ;)). You got to try the very first puzzle hunt (have my puzzle design skills improved since then, my love?) of our relationship--though it clearly wasn't the last!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And my goodness, what a perfect day for a 3 month anniversary!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="module__title__link">March </span>14th to April 13th</h2>
<p>March 14th was a blast--I got a beautiful paper rose from a beautiful (not paper) lady :) You have no idea how much it meant to me to receive that rose. Even the smallest things you do mean so, so much to me, Isabel, since it just makes me ecstatic that the Incredible Isabel was thinking about me. We got to have so much together fun that day, and I'm glad we got to spend it together before the whole COVID-19 thing happened. But even with the Coronabreak, I'm glad I got to spend time with you. I'm glad we got to have weekend phone dates, and that we got to play us some "We Were Here" (spooky theatre demons!) and solve some Princeton Puzzle Hunt puzzles. I always have a blast whenever I'm with you, Isabel, even if "with you" means "with your voice via the telephone network."</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="module__title__link">April </span>14th to May 13th</h2>
<p>The rise of the morning calls! While coronabreak does mean less in person time, surely the advent of morning calls means that we get to spend more total time together throughout the month!</p>
<p>We also had some woofin' good math-y times, and I was privy to your very first (and hopefully not last) usage of the dog joke during math time, even if I didn't realize it at first and you had to remind me of it during a morning call afterwards...</p>
<p>We got through some Rota and did some really cool lattice stuff, I got to read your beautiful combinatorial argument about binomial coefficients modulo <em>p</em>, we read some Additive Number Theory together, and we started reading some Classical Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory together, my love!</p>
<p>We started a Terraria world together, and in no time together destroyed the Eye of Cthulu (twice, no less! poor Cthulu is now blind), the Brain of Cthulu (what did Cthulu ever do to us?), and spooky Skeletron!</p>
<p>And more seriously, we got to talk about some more emotional things. I felt safe being vulnerable with you about my feelings, and you responded so supportively to just everything.</p>
