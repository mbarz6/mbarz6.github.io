<p>Congraulations on helping me cross the road! Now, we can begin the safari! Firstly, I encountered Michelle's birthday! Happy birthday, Michelle!</p>

<p>(Math note: It turns out that in any finite field, all functions are realizable as polynomials! One can do it by first noticing that the function which sends everything to 0 except for 0, which is sent to -1, is a polynomial of degree -1, namely <em>x<sup>q-1</sup> - 1</em>, essentially by Fermat's little theorem for finite fields. Then, every possible function can be represented as a sum combination of functions of the form <em>a(x-b)<sup>q-1</sup> - 1</em>. Additionally, without knowing who Fermat was, one can discover this simply by cleverly exploiting finiteness of the field: Take the product of <em>x-a</em> over all but one element of the field to get a function which is zero almost everywhere, and form linear combinations of these functions to finish.)</p>
