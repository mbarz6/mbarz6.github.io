<p>(Math note: It turns out that in any finite field, all functions are realizable as polynomials! There are a few ways of noticing this: First, Lagrange interpolation works, meaning that there's a degree <em>q</em> polynomial realizing any function. Additionally, one can do it by first noticing that the function which sends everything to 0 except for 0, which is sent to -1, is a polynomial of degree -1, namely <em>x<sup>q-1</sup> - 1</em>, essentially by Fermat's little theorem for finite fields. Then, every possible function can be represented as a sum combination of functions of the form <em>a(x-b)<sup>q-1</sup> - 1</em>/)</p>
