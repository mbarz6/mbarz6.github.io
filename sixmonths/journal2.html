<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday, 11/17/19</span></p>
<p>I saw "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog" today. Short and sweet. A lot of films seem to try and subvert the superhero genre by making an antagonist central and villains more morally justifable than heroes. This was par for the course there, but entertaing mildily. Average.</p>
<p>Also, YESTERDAY AND THURSDAY WERE ISABEL DATES. On Thursday, Isabel and I got introduced properly and it felt so nice. I really like her. But it ended when I asked her at Belmont how she felt about me romantically, and she admitted she didn't but she did want to hang out platonically.</p>
<p>Well, on Saturday, a 180: She thought it over and said she is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">starting</span> to like me. A win in my book (ha [editor's note: This is literally a win written in my book.].).</p>
<p>Texted her this morning, had Sarah keep my phone on her during NCP Open House so that I wouldn't keep checking it. When I saw she replied afterwards, I panic[k]ed and got coffee with Sarah to delay going home and reading it. I was SO happy when I read it, and we had a lil' conversation. I asked her [scribbles; probably a write-o] to keep texting with me, waiting on a reply.</p>
<p>I really hope I don't come off as too clingy or needy or pathetic. But, God, I really want to talk with her. [scribbles; probably a write-o] Ahhh.... this is so hard.</p>
